    DONE! implement show and hide feature for departure and destination boxes on flight_deet page
    DONE! Make all pages in Menu bar symmetric.
    DONE! Make dark mode switch symmetric
    DONE! Make the flight deet page more like the google flight packet. search `i 492` to view the flight deet
    DONE! Use Dark mode across the web.
